# Ulmus - Grav CMS | An [ELMS:LN](https://www.elmsln.org/) Project

Open Ulmus is an [open collective](https://opencollective.com/openulmus "Open Collective - Open Ulmus") sustained project for the public production and sharing of knowledge.

Open Ulmus helps open source communities spread knowledge by offering a space to build trainings available to anyone with the ELMS:LN platform that is open to anyone. Groups that build courses within Open Ulmus can offer training at tiered and free prices -- with a portion funds generated by students sent back to these groups to support their endeavors.
